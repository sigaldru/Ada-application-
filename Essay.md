1.  **Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**

In the last couple of years I have been looking for my true passion, and what would I like to do in my career. I believe that I found the answer a few months ago. I want to be in Tech! I want to do programming! I want my job to impact the future and to improve people’s lives. 
I was first exposed to software developing a few years ago when I moved to the United States from Israel. We were living with my cousin who is a computer programmer and I found it very interesting to peek at his computer, and see what he was doing. Since then I have been curious about coding and programing but never really had the courage to try. About a year ago I start building my website and I really enjoyed the challenge, I took few online courses in HTML and CSS with Code Academy and I find it interesting and easier than what I was expecting.
2. **If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**

My goal after the program is to be working at a big software development company, learning how the industry works and also improving my programing skills. Further down the road I wish to pursue a career in UX or web design. 
3. **After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?**

I was born and raised in a special community in Israel called [Kiboutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz). The Kiboutz (Hebrew word for “communal settlement”) is a unique rural community and a society dedicated to mutual aid and social justice. It is a socioeconomic system based on the principle of joint ownership of property, equality and cooperation of production, consumption and education and the fulfillment of the idea “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”.  
The Ada Mission and the way I grew up have a lot in common: Giving, sharing and accepting is part of my life and my beliefs. You can tell from my resume that working with youth was always a passion of mine and I hope that one day I will get the opportunity to volunteer in a young women’s program to teach and share my computer knowledge, show them what great tools we have and open there minds to think beyond everything they know so far. 
4. **Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**
 
The mistake I’m going to tell you about is not a technical mistake or related to a computer issue. But I feel the need to share, as it really impacted my life.
About half a year ago I was on maternity leave at home with my 2 month old. I suddenly heard him choking in his bed, apparently choking from his own spit up. He was not breathing for almost a minute in my hands. I was helpless and didn’t know what to do to help or save him. After the minute that felt forever, he started breathe again. He is a healthy and happy baby, but this situation could have ended differently because of my lack of knowledge. I immediately did a CPR course for babies, and I will recommend to any moms out there to do it. It might save your child!
